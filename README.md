# Cheryl's Manager README
## What is this?
This thing?  This is a concept that’s been floating around some Eng Managers circles.  Yeah, it’s kinda weird, but also kinda neat.  Learning how to work with a new manager can be hard.  For some folks, it can be an anxiety-inducing phase until we figure things out.  This README aims to help alleviate some of that anxiety and jump-start our working relationship.

## My management philosophy
* I am here to help **you** be successful.  I want to make sure you have the support you need to succeed as a team and as an individual in your career.
* Teams work best when they can have fun together.  Taking time to learn about each other and share a funny meme every now and then makes work feel like less of a grind and makes the team one you want to be a part of.
* The burden is on me to establish communication and feedback mechanisms that work for you.  Feedback on what’s working and what isn’t will help this work better :)

## What you can expect from me
### Weekly 1x1s
This time is for you to talk about your career and how you feel things are going.  Status updates can be left to stand ups / Jira comments.  I’ll create a shared agenda doc for things I’d like to talk about and notes I take.  I encourage you to add things you want to talk about too, if you find it helpful in guiding our discussions.

Our weekly 1x1s are “minimum checkpoints”.  If you need me for anything, you are always welcome to grab me at my desk, put some time on my calendar, or just grab me for lunch or a coffee break.  I can move meetings if needed.

### Enthusiastic Support
I will enthusiastically support your growth and actively help you find opportunities to grow, learn, and increase your exposure and influence.  (see Known Quirks section for additional info)

### Questions
I might ask questions in stand ups, on code reviews, in tickets, in person, etc.  I ask questions to:
* **Learn.**  You know a lot more about your work than I do.  Understanding why things are done in a certain way will help me help you more effectively.
* **Establish a shared understanding.**  If it’s not clear that everyone’s on the same page (myself included!), I’ll ask questions to make sure everyone can walk away with a clear understanding of expectations.
* **Help refine ideas.**  I might ask questions to ferret out problems we haven’t thought of yet, or to see if there are additional ways we can improve upon an idea.

I do NOT ask questions to put you on the spot.  If you prefer a different way for me to get this information, please let me know.

### NO SURPRISES
Not knowing what your manager thinks of your performance is unsettling. I try to give as much in the moment feedback as I can, but sometimes it may be delayed due to meetings, getting behind on email, etc.  I will set up formal checkins in the middle of evaluation periods to take a close look at where things stand and give feedback to help get you to where you want to go for the quarter / 6 mo / 1 year.  I also use a collaborative approach for writing your evaluation so you know exactly what I'll write.

### Code (sometimes)
Even though I’m a manager, I’m still an engineer at heart and I get sad if it’s been too long since I’ve written code (like a week, tops).  When I do write code, I:
* try to pick work that’s not in the critical path.  I don’t want to block people or products because I have too many meetings.  This can be tricky sometimes because if it’s not critical path stuff, then why would we do it?
* highly value your code reviews.  You will likely know the language / platform / team specific idioms way better than I do.  Don’t hold back on things like style, convention and refactoring suggestions (in addition to correctness comments).

I also really enjoy participating in design discussions / brainstorming solutions, so don’t be surprised if I sit in on these types of discussions within the team. 

### Puns and other bad jokes.
Sorry, I can’t help it.

## How you can help me
### If something isn’t working, please let me know.
If you are uncomfortable delivering this kind of feedback to me directly, you can speak to my manager to have them relay the message.  I am also open to written feedback in email / slack / etc.

I don’t expect you to provide solutions to everything.  If something doesn’t feel right, let me know and we can talk through it.

### Talk to me about your career goals.
The more I know, the more I can do to help you achieve them.  Not being sure what you want is also fine.  Let’s work together to figure that out :)

### Give me a heads up about potential issues as soon as you can.
Even just a “spidey sense” that things feel off.  This can cover a wide range of things, from delays in completing tasks, questions about prioritization, weird interpersonal interactions or tensions between teammates, etc.

## Known Quirks
### I get super excited in helping people grow.
I love seeking out opportunities for people to try new things.  Sometimes I get too excited.  If I push you too much, or suggest too many things and you need help prioritizing, please let me know.  I won’t be offended if you tell me I should slow down a bit or back off.

### I talk a lot.
I ramble, one might say.  I dislike silence.  If you need silence, or need me to stop talking and listen, you can tell me “I need you to just listen”.  If that’s too direct, we can come up with a code phrase.  Maybe “banana”.

### Also, I work a lot.
I have a hard time sleeping if there’s a task left unfinished or a problem left unsolved.  I do NOT expect you to do the same.  If I see you putting in long hours, expect that I’ll check in and make sure you’re doing it because you want to (like me), not because you feel like you have to.

### I have a weirdly high tolerance for process.
This is great for you, because I will power through process-heavy things (like promotions, planning events, etc.) so you don’t have to bear the full brunt of it.  I love figuring out how to “work the system”.  I derive substantial satisfaction from learning the ins and outs of how a system / process works and helping other folks navigate things quickly with minimal pain.  Maybe my next career should be as a sherpa (lol, just kidding.  I hate the cold).

However, my tolerance for process means I also have a blind spot when team processes get too cumbersome.  I need you to help keep me in check there.

### I start with a light touch when dealing with performance issues...
...because this is the approach that works best for those who have to manage me.  I will seek to understand what might be going on (unclear expectations, personal issues, etc), but will let you know if I am concerned that things aren't on track.

If things don't improve, expect direct feedback that expectations aren't being met with examples to help arrive at a shared understanding.

## In Conclusion
I hope this helps you get a sense of what working with me will be like.  If you feel at any time that I am not living up to this document, call me out on it.  You can always soften the blow with funny cat gifs.

I look forward to working with and learning from all of you!
